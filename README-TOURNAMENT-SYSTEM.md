# TokenRivals Tournament System

A real-time cryptocurrency tournament system where players compete by betting on token price movements using their selected squad of tokens.

## Features

- **Real-time Price Tracking**: Uses Pyth Network price feeds for live cryptocurrency prices
- **WebSocket Room Management**: Separate server handles room creation, joining, and handshaking
- **60-Second Tournaments**: Live tournaments with real-time progress tracking
- **Long/Short Betting**: Players can bet on price going up (LONG) or down (SHORT)
- **Squad Building**: Players select tokens for different positions (Strikers, Midfielders, Defenders)
- **Real-time Charts**: Live progress charts showing squad value changes
- **Winner Determination**: Automatic winner calculation based on percentage changes

## How It Works

### Tournament Rules

1. **LONG Betting**: Player bets token prices will go UP
   - Score = % increase in squad value during the match
   - Higher percentage increase = better score

2. **SHORT Betting**: Player bets token prices will go DOWN
   - Score = -% decrease in squad value during the match
   - Higher percentage decrease = better score (negative becomes positive)

3. **Winner**: Player with the higher score wins

### Game Flow

1. **Squad Selection**: Players select tokens for their squad on the home screen
2. **Room Creation**: Host creates a room and gets a room code
3. **Room Joining**: Guest enters the room code to join
4. **Handshaking**: Host accepts the guest's connection
5. **Tournament Start**: 60-second live tournament begins
6. **Real-time Tracking**: Live price updates and progress charts
7. **Winner Declaration**: Automatic winner determination and results display

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "activeRooms": 2,
  "activeClients": 4,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - Ensure server is running on port 3001
